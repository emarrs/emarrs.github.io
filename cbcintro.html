        <h1 style="color: white;">Comfort Breeds Complicity</h1>
        <h1 style="font-size: 1em; color: white;">What if the corporations selling us products operated with complete transparency, exposing their methods to remain competitive in globalized late capitalism? What if they were upfront about the ways they exploit both the consumer and the workers who create these products?<br>
        The purpose of this imaginary clothing catalog is to exaggerate the extreme but often overlooked ironies behind such corporations selling products to consumers to make them feel good about themselves. Jeff Bezos, CEO of Amazon, famously said that he wants his employees to “wake up terrified” of not being productive enough at work. This "comfort breeds complacency" philosophy drives workers to produce at an exponentially efficient rate.<br>
        However, the goal of selling products cheaply and quickly is to deliver comfort to the consumer. Consumer complacency is good for corporations, because as long as the consumer remains comfortable within the system, they will feel less inclined to question its longterm sustainability and therefore remain complicit. Thus, the catalog's title, "Comfort Breeds Complicity." Each product in the catalog is inspired by a real-life example of corporate profiting off anti-corporate or anti-establishment values.

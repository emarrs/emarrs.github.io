        <h3 id="fuckdesign">Fuck Design</h3><p>However, the reasons why I “design” are irrelevant. What matters more, if we’re looking at what I as an individual can contribute to the world, is “what are my interests?” Replace “design” with any other verb--why do I breathe, write, eat, sleep, share, lick, blink, walk, see? What makes “design” sooo much more special as a verb, other than its ability to shroud me in clout and deliver my paycheck? When we revere the word “design” as this fetishized piece of magic, we permit ourselves entry into a dream-world where ailments can be cured by applying the sensuous tonic of “design,” losing ourselves in the idealistic fantasy-scape of the word itself without making much effort to engage with its actual implications. This famous detachment between the graphic designer and the content that they “design” is something that I hope to evade in my practice as a designer. This detachment inhibits our desire and ability to engage with the author of the content, who we should be thinking of not as our client, but our collaborator. This detachment breeds indifference where there should be deference. It puts up walls which can trap our creativity, leaving us with nothing but desperation.</p>

    <h3 id="interestspace">Interest Space</h3><p>My personal interest space lies within sociology for the most part; I’m forever fascinated by how societies are designed and studying this with a critical eye. I am fascinated by the effects of capitalism on our daily lives, manifesting in consumer culture, pop culture, media, and well, literally everything. I wonder about the strategies we use to express our identities, and whether any of our identities matter or we’re all just big posers shopping at Zara and Savers. I’m interested in our contemporary obsession with individualism, whether it’s “natural” or simply a byproduct of a systemic obsession with efficiency, competition, and profit. Why do we tend to favor isolation rather than inclusion? I’m interested in the structures that impose divisions among us, and how design is used as a tool to either reinforce these divisions or break them apart.
     <br><br>
    I find that the more obsessively we find ourselves chasing the ideal of the uniquely exceptional, productive and innovative self, the more we see the subversion of intellectual property--namely, “bootlegging.” I’m fascinated by the variety of ways different entities approach and utilize bootlegging within this strange untrustworthy post-Postmodernist world. In this day and age, as individuals constantly battle to one-up each other in innovation, we start to question whether there is any point to inventing the new. As my high school art teacher told me in response to my concerns that my Photoshop drawings weren’t original enough: “The original is dead.” To look at a semiotic signifier of prestige (like the Chanel logo, for example) and then to disseminate it from “high culture” to mass culture is perhaps a way to democratize it. A new dynamic is formed when the “high culture” bootlegs the mass culture, and signifiers attached to low-class low-culture enter into luxury spheres, creating a kind of nefarious class appropriation. But what’s really stirring up the pot is the new reality of robot-on-human bootlegging (robootlegging) (but we’ll get to that later, I haven;t done the research).
    <br><br>

    We even experience bootlegging within our own classrooms--students often get called out for “plagiarizing” existing graphic design projects, sometimes even from their own peers’ portfolios. What does this desperate act of copying indicate about the connection we feel to our projects? Do we care more about satisfying the prompt, or creating things that are meaningful to us? Are we just lazy, or is the constant pressure to conjure the new and invent simply impossible to keep up with?  How can we come to terms with this postmodern reality, embrace it and create within it self-reflexive work that isn’t necessarily new, but is self-aware and derived from a genuine personal interest? 
    <br><br>
    When we do work hard enough to create what we believe to be original ideas and forms, and we see a peer cutting corners and copying something that already exists, it feels unfair. This copycat has failed, in our minds, to live up to our same moralized standard of originality or authenticity, and we often attribute that to laziness or indifference. Instinctively, we wish to raise attention to the unjust, thus creating a call-out culture in which we police our peers’ violation of intellectual property rights. In a world where low-profile artists constantly see their work appropriated (without credit or pay) as the “inspiration” for corporate art directors’ advertising campaigns (ahem Nike), should students be policing each other, or attacking the more powerful intellectual property thieves? 
    <br><br>
    Something we can learn from both the plagiarism of our own peers and of corporate creative departments is that individual creativity doesn’t work as a commodity. It’s neither infinite nor finite; it’s not a resource that lies dormant in an individual until located, to be mined, chipped away then scooped up and traded for gold. Whether you’re one student trying to crank out a project for class, or you’re an art direction team for a new corporate campaign, sometimes you find yourself incapable of producing an original idea. However, the constant cycle of deadlines in a curriculum or product development system designed to pump out new things allows no breathing room to accommodate for gaps in creativity. So, maliciously or not, you may take the leap of faith and use the idea that is not yours to take, just to get the job done. I believe this lack of breathing room is where the problem lies. The pressure to produce according to predetermined schedule imposes dehumanizing constraints on human creativity. How can you develop organic ideas derived from passionate creativity when your creativity is treated as an inexhaustible fountain, to be tapped from whenever necessary, to suit any product or service? The task of completing the assignment becomes the first priority, eclipsing the value of producing organic work from the heart.
    Maybe it’s time for us to reevaluate the question, not of “why we design” but “why we do anything.” Frankly, we design for money and for clout. And we might as well keep on doing that, so that we can pay our rent and survive. But in our personal time, we can ponder other things: For what do we engage? What inspires us? Why do we wonder, wander, get lost? And how to we get there?
    <br><br>
    Perhaps this formulates into design practice by releasing our vicelike grip on the steering wheel of the Morality and Intellectual Property Police cruiser even if that means we swerve off the Freeway to Fame and Fortune. WHat I’m saying is, what if we stopped beating the shit out of ourselves for two seconds and allowed ourselves to be swallowed up by our passions and inspirations and interact with them heedlessly? What if we stopped squinting into the sun of innovation and exception, and indulged in the luxury of generating the unoriginal and unexceptional? Who knows, we might end up accidentally creating something exceptional through empathy, our defiance of indifference.

    <br><br>
    In my personal design practice, I find empathy through inquiry and deliberation. I do a lot of research projects exploring avenues of interest within material and sociological culture. I try not to design for the sake of designing, but to read and learn about a subject and then use design tools(?) to synthesize my findings or interpretations into engaging material. I believe that value does not exist inherently in form, but value (keeping in mind that “value” is subjective) is something that marries form through empathy. To me, design is nothing but a vessel for information, whether that information is data, text, or simply feelings. No offense to the “Fuck Content” folks but information exists to be engaged with (unless it doesn’t…) and it’s up to us to make it accessible. That’s not to say it’s our job to “dumb things down;” I like to think of design as synthesizing information and data and representing it in an organized matter with relevant context. I believe, in the vein of Sheila, that this can be done without oversimplifying information into its reductive parts, (or “essence,” the common euphemism), and without presenting it as a singular message to be efficiently understood and accepted without room for interpretation or subjectivity. It also doesn’t mean to represent information in a way that is purposefully confusing or illegible. I am in search of that sweet spot, somewhere in between Beatrice Ward and Michael Rock in philosophy.
     <br><br>
    Ultimately, design is a framework for me to critique the structures I’m part of and explore the implications of my complicity within them. I wish to propose bootlegging as a design methodology to facilitate our navigation through our contemporary globalized, technocratic, late-capitalist condition. As a graphic designer, I find myself often struggling to find my place within this condition, on which I am reliant and complicit to varying extents, grappling with the implications inherent in the practice relating to advertisement, branding and identity crafting. At my moments of uncertainty and hypocrisy, I find it useful to embrace the ironic wrinkles in the system which perplex and frustrate me, and use them as inspiration, raw material to be reappropriated and reworked, even subverted. It is easier for me to navigate my contentious feelings when I create work that doesn’t attempt to shout anything new, but reflects directly upon existing conditions and provides a different lens to view them through--whether that lens is respectful, satirical, somber, subversive, deconstructive, or totally neutral. This “bootlegging” methodology can reveal itself literally or figuratively--it is defined by its decidedly unoriginal, unexceptional approach to making, driven not by a desire for pure innovation but education and interaction with the crucial aspects of the already-existing conditions in which we practice.
    <br><br>
    This framework has no innate ties to form, only to intention. It is translated through form via a plurality of modes for representation, to which I have no desire to attempt to assign hierarchy. It utilizes methods of visual borrowing, reevaluating ideas around copying: plagiarism, stealing, appropriation, subversion. I once attended a design conference where I heard Harvard-educated designer and computer engineer Dr. Ling Fan speak about his practice and new company, called Tezign. Through Tezign, Dr. Fan works to engineer AI’s that are equipped with knowledge of design fundamentals (formulas) necessary to automate marketing materials for “future businesses.” I distinctly remember him describing his intentions in inventing these design-bots: to “democratize design.” My initial reaction was something like “oh please! This guy’s out to ruin my and my peers’ careers--we’re supposed to be the only ones equipped with the training to create new designs.” And while it’s true that the romantic education my peers and I receive inspires us to create objectively more beautiful and sensuous work than the examples he showed us that his AI had generated, it solidified the reality to me that conventional graphic design really is nothing but formulas. Perhaps if we feel threatened by these formulas being part of the public domain (surely if they can be fed to robots, any regular person can learn them too) then we should try to detach ourselves from the Modernist exceptionalism with which we associate Graphic Design and ourselves.
    <br><br>
    Maybe there is something valuable in this spooky idea of “democratizing design” through condensing it into formulas. I hardly believe that bots designing crappy product advertisements for large businesses are “democratizing” anything, but perhaps we could figure out how carve out space for ourselves within this pseudo-democratization. One project that I would love to execute is learning to create my own AI design-bot. I could teach him about my favorite visual problem-solving techniques and he could help me come up with ideas when I am in a creative rut but my school or job isn’t allowing me time to figure it out for myself. We could become friends. I could introduce him to my other friends, and he could learn from them and how to assist them as well. He doesn’t have to be an evil robot making icky web banners for Alibaba and Amazon. He will be our commodified creativity, presenting us with artificial ideas at times when  and we will be the ones to apply his strengths strategically to be a force of good.
    <br><br>
    However, our bootlegged reconciliation with the globalized technocracy does not have to imply making more robots. I still think there is plenty to explore within good old analog text-to-image-making. I’d love to see the graphic designer becoming more of an author in any form, not being afraid to interact with the text they are tasked to design. I love to see notes and doodles, any evidence of conversation between author and designer. (this is kind of a post modern idea… :) )

    <br><br>
    I also propose that we expand our spectrum of what we regard as “design tools.” The fact that Adobe owns a complete monopoly over industry-standard design tools necessary to be an employable designer is something I’d like to see change. What if we challenged ourselves to explore more diverse, accessible mediums, like handwriting, painting, and default computer applications? Drawing tools on Snapchat and Instagram? What if we could code on flip phones? Can we achieve similar or more interesting results imitating conventionally respected design forms while using low-fidelity mediums?

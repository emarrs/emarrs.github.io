        <div id="stepatext"><h1>Stepanova Constructivist Romper</h1><p>Varvara Stepanova was an avant-garde artist and designer in revolutionary and early Soviet Russia. In the 1920s, she shifted into a more utilitarian rather than spiritual or artistic design practice. This design philosophy came to be known as Constructivism.<br><br>

        While other Constructivists worked in industrial and graphic design, Stepanova created apparel. She rejected the frivolous, ornamental elements of bourgeois clothing and aimed to create items that excelled in functionality while maintaining a geometric, visually strong design. Her sport outfits exemplified the value she placed in producing unisex apparel that people of Soviet Russian society could wear at work and at play.<br><br>

        Since most of Stepanovaâ€™s designs exist as two-dimensional drawings, I decided to bring one of them to life as a modern 3D interpretation and see how these ultra-geometric silhouettes could apply to the organic human body. Based on her sketches, I designed my own sport romper, tailored to the context of the year 2018, the fabric and design altered to suit the current styles that people like to wear. I sewed it out of functional sport fabrics typically used in basketball uniforms, and modeled the shape off running shorts and soccer jerseys.<br><br>
